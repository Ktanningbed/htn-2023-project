# Hoowik

Hoowik glasses, powered by Adhawk Microservices technology, are a remarkable breakthrough in assistive devices designed to enhance the lives of visually impaired individuals and those with depth perception challenges. By incorporating eyeball and gaze detection capabilities, we can create audible alerts for detecting nearby objects, serve as a powerful tool for preventing accidents and empowering individuals to explore the world with greater confidence. In the ever-evolving assistive technology landscape, Hoowik glasses represent a transformative leap towards a more inclusive and accessible future for all.

## Inspiration
Visual problems are a prevalent and significant health concern worldwide, affecting people of all ages. Here are some key statistics related to visual problems:

Global Visual Impairment: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 2.2 billion people worldwide have some form of visual impairment or blindness. This includes a wide range of conditions, from mild to severe.

Blindness and Moderate to Severe Visual Impairment: Approximately 285 million people globally are estimated to be visually impaired, with 39 million classified as blind and 246 million experiencing moderate to severe visual impairment.

We decided to create Hoowik to help those who are visually impaired or suffering from depth perception.

Here's a closer look at the key aspects of this technology:

Object Detection: The integration of the Adhawk Microsystems API enables Hoowik glasses to monitor the area around the wearer continuously. When an object is detected within a small, pre-defined distance from the glasses, the system swiftly identifies it.

Alarm System: The alarm mechanism is a critical safety feature. When an object is detected in close proximity to the user, an immediate alarm is triggered. This audio or tactile alert serves as a real-time warning, helping individuals avoid potential collisions or accidents. The speed and accuracy of the alarm response are crucial in preventing mishaps.

Live Statistics: Besides real-time object detection and alarms, Hoowik glasses provide users with live statistics. These statistics display the distance of objects from the wearer over time, offering valuable insights into the changing environment. Users can monitor the proximity of objects as they move through different spaces, making it easier to plan their movements and avoid obstacles.
